            Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March
            14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later
            on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved
            to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland
            and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in
            Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In
            1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship
            and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a
            position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905
            he obtained his doctor’s degree.

            Einstein’s name has become synonymous with genius and creativity.
            Named Person of the Century by TIME in 1999, Einstein is a rare
            icon, whose wisdom extended far beyond the realm of science to
            reveal a man with an almost childlike sense of wonder and a profound
            love of humanity.
